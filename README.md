# Demo Project using ts-jest

The goal is to create a TypeScript project that can do all of the following:

* Compile code as an es5 library that can be published as a Node module with typings.
* Using `jest` and `ts-jest` for testing.
* Provides proper stack traces for failed tests.
* Provide accurate code coverage metrics.
